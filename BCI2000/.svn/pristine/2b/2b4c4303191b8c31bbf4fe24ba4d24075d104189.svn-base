 BEGIN_STATE_DEFINITIONS

  // IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT BUFFEREDADC AND STATES:  
  // * BCI2000 States can only be populated "per sample" if they're populated synchronously.
  // * States can only be populated synchronously by calling State( "Y" )( idx ) = X; in OnProcess.
  // * States can also be populated asynchronously by calling bcievent << "Y" << x; in DoAcquire.
  // * Asynchronous state population using bcievent cannot occur per sample, but only per sampleblock.
  // * If a state changes multiple times in a single sample block, data WILL BE LOST using the bcievent interface.
  // * This presents a problem for many amplifier APIs because many of them must be instantiated and run in a single
  //   thread (they are not thread-safe) and access to API state data must be managed carefully if its needed in the main thread.

  // have already been deleted:  set them to NULL after deletion).
