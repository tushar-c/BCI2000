FFT support in BCI2000

The BCI2000 FFT Filter makes use of the free FFTW3 library by Mateo Frigo and Steven G. Johnson.
This is the fastest and most reliable FFT implementation available today, and also used internally by Matlab.

The full binary package containing the FFTW DLL may be downloaded from
