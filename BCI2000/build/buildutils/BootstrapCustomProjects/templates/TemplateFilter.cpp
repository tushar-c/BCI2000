  // Parameter( "Milk" );
  // State( "Bananas" );

  // Also check that the values of any parameters are sane:
  //
  // if( (float)Parameter( "Denominator" ) == 0.0f )
  //      bcierr << "Denominator cannot be zero" << endl;
  // 
  // Errors issued in this way, during Preflight, still allow the user to open
  // the Config dialog box, fix bad parameters and re-try.  By contrast, errors
  // and C++ exceptions at any other stage (outside Preflight) will make the
  // system stop, such that BCI2000 will need to be relaunched entirely.

  // Let's imagine this filter has only one output, namely the amount of stuff detected in the signal:
  // Output.SetChannels( 1 );
  // Output.ChannelLabels()[0] = "Stuff";

  // Imagine we want to output twice as many samples (or bins) as we receive from the input:
  // Output.SetElements( Input.Elements() * 2 );
  
  // Note that the ` instance itself, and its members, are read-only during
  // this phase, due to the "const" at the end of the Preflight prototype above.
  // Any methods called by Preflight must also be "const" in the same way.
